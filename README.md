# DINO with Modified Image Reconstruction
This repository contains the implementation of DINO (Distillation with No Labels) with modifications to include an image reconstruction task, inspired by Multi-Concept Self-Supervised Learning (MC-SSL). 
The project leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust visual representations without labeled data and explores the integration of reconstruction tasks to enhance learning.
DINO is a self-supervised learning framework that utilizes Vision Transformers to learn high-quality image representations without labeled data.
This repository extends the DINO approach by incorporating an image reconstruction task to investigate the potential benefits of combining global feature learning with local detail reconstruction.
